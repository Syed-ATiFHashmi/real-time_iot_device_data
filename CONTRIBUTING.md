# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! Small, focused contributions are easiest to review and merge.

Guidelines:

- Open an issue first for anything significant (new feature, breaking change) so we can discuss scope.
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch off `main` for your change. Use descriptive branch names like `fix/device-card-bug`.
- Keep changes small and focused. Prefer multiple small PRs over one large one.
- Run linting before submitting: `npm run lint`.
- Add tests for new features or bug fixes when possible.
- Follow the existing TypeScript and Tailwind conventions.

When your PR is ready, please include:
- A short description of what the change does and why.
- Any relevant screenshots if the change affects UI.
- Links to related issues if present.

Thanks — maintainers will review and request changes when necessary.
